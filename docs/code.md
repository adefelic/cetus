## PROJECT TODO

- rename "render" dir and files to "loop" or "synchronous" ?
	- it could be renamed to "update". "update_encounter", "update_explore", etc. the goal of everything is to render, it doesn't make sense as a signifier
- rename "input" dir and files to "interrupt" or "async" ?


## NAMES
- the ... 12 row? window towards the top.
	- EVENT_LABEL
	- EVENT_LABEL_WINDOW
- the 4 row, full width menu at the bottom
	- BOTTOM_MENU
- enemy
	- ENCOUNTER_NPC
	- OPPONENT
- moves you can do in an encounter
	- SKILLS (not attacks) (would call them actions but it's too general -- "use item" and "talk" also are "actions")

ok gotta figure out - v0 of STATS, ITEMIZATION, ABILITIES, COMBAT

- equipment: wep, icon, head, armor, legs, other, other, other
	- wep and icon
		- each has a power stat
		- each confers 2 moves
		- wep moves do a physical type of damage
			- except when they don't! very cool
			- each different move should do a different damage type, or target a different # of enemies
		- icon moves do a special type of damage
			- except when they don't!
			- each different move should do a different damage type, or target a different # of enemies
		- you can change weapon or icon in combat, costs a turn. this is our pokemon switching.
		- weps and icons scale with stats
	- armor + other
		- gives resistances to types + a defense number
		- amulets give allegiance/covenant bonuses, which can 
			- boost damage types?
				- boost specific moves? like flower moves, or moon moves. lets you build a spec a little
			- let you avoid certain combats?

### player stats
- the decisions that we want the player to make are more along the lines of the aesthetic and political than gameplay. 
- more like chosen ideology than a description of how smart you are
- you put points into these things and gear will scale with them.
- stats are
	- endurance / wholeness ?
		- hp
	- willpower / will
		- mp
	- the claw
		- nature (beast / bird of prey. predator, k-strategist, darwinistic, brutal, perfection?)
	- the root
		- nature (plant / prey, r-strategist, spreading wide, making mistakes?) green
	- the tower
		- human (agrarian settler, infrastructural, future-oriented) white
	- the wind
		- human (hunter/gatherer nomad, present-oriented) brown
	- the echo
		- the dead (past-oriented, memorializers, archivists)

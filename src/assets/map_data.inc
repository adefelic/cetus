SECTION "Map Data", ROMX

; the current map struct has two bits per wall. this means a wall can be open or one of 3 types
; 4 bits per wall would give 15 wall types. that sounds reasonable for now? there could be different wall sets per level
; i also think it makes sense for now to have table to govern both room graphics and collision

Maps::
DEF MAP1 EQU $00
; todo this will require a GetMap addr function

Map1::
Map1Header::
; todo add starting orientation
; todo add starting coords
; todo add map width, height maybe?

; the "wall map"
; this is essentially a collision map that we're building through indices in vram for the pausemap tiles.
; todo it should be its own thing
; this can be printed to screen by making it writing it to tilemap vram, but only the top 18 rows, 20 columns

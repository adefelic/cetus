### UI planning

when you select an equipment slot, there needs to be two kinds of info displayed:
1. the other items that can go in the slot
	- each has a name
	- each has an icon, potentially

2. the effects of the item currently selected

we have 4, 18 character rows for text:
"item name"
" move 1 cost dmg type"
"                  "
"                  "

- encounters are dangerous and the map is confusing
-> decorate outdoor with items to make the map less confusing
-> encounters comment on items that you leave around
-> some encounters begin to become easier


safety and danger

safety or information?
rather than map drawing like in etrian odyssey, there will be no map, but there will be modifications to the map

map modifications
	- need to make returning to an area less tense and less of a resource expenditure 
	- 


- things that make re-traversal easier
	- is there a way to lay out a correct path?
		- lay out bread crumbs as you're going, scoop then back up if there's a dead-end
			- idk what happens here when there's a circular path, if the point is to draw the shortest path
				- maybe the point is to nail down what an acceptable path is. maybe other markers could be used to flag dead-ends
					- maybe a different kind of item to flag dead-ends that could be interesting


let's try that again
- things that make a return trip and exploration easier
	- breadcrumb
		- kind of the bare minimum
	- lower encounter rate
	- monsters respond to what you've dropped around them and 
		- give you things?

kinds of people
- tower builders (human)
	- settlers
	- rangers
- forest
	- insects, mammals, birds, plants
- dead
	- skeletons, ghosts, memories
- deep
	- bog creatures
	- undersea flora and fauna

what do the people kinds like
- tower builders
	- settlers
		- fortifications. infrastructure like signs or post boxes
	- rangers
		- useful temporary structures. camping things
- forest dwellers
	- high
		- food
		- shiny things (found mostly in the deep?)
	- low
		- habitat
		- food
- deep
	- 
- dead - like being remembered
	- memorials
	- eerie things

item ideas
- torch
	- all fear fire
- lamp
	- permanent torch?
- flagstone
- campfire + stool
	- 
- lean-to
- tent platform
- tiny cabin
- tree ornaments
	- wind chimes
	- dream catcher
	- straw effigy
- cairn
- tiny statue
- monument (tiny obelisk)
- sun dial
- burning incense mound
	- the dead like this
- sea shell
	- scallop
	- snail
	- smell bad to land people
- pearl
- driftwood
- shiny rock
- plank bridge
- signpost / sign
- supply box
	- press a once a traversal to get a random health item maybe


where do items come from
- sometimes when you fight or talk to a monster, they will give you or drop something
- sometimes you can find materials when exploring
	- ugh crafting. maybe if you can bring them to towns people and they will make you nice things
